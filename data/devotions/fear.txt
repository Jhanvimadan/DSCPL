Scripture: “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.” — 2 Timothy 1:7

Prayer:
Lord, help me replace fear with faith. Fill my heart with courage and remind me of Your promises. I trust in Your perfect plan. Amen.

Declaration:
Fear has no place in me. I am bold, strong, and protected by God.

Reflection:
The enemy thrives in fear, but God empowers you with boldness. Meditate on His love when fear rises.

Topic: Overcoming Fear

Scripture: Isaiah 41:10  
"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."

Devotional:
Fear is a natural emotion, but it doesnâ€™t have to control your life. When anxiety creeps in, remember that God has promised to stand by your side. Trust that His presence is greater than anything you're facing. He goes before you and stands behind you, covering you in His grace.

Prayer:
Lord, I surrender my fears to You. Remind me daily that I am not alone. Help me walk boldly in Your strength and not in my weakness. I place my confidence in You.

Declaration:
I am fearless because God is with me. I will not be shaken.

Reflection Prompt:
What fear is holding you back today? How can you invite God into that space?

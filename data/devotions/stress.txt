Scripture: “Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.” — 1 Peter 5:7

Prayer:
Father, I come before You with a heavy heart, overwhelmed by the pressures of life. Please take my burdens and replace them with Your peace. Help me trust You more and lean on You through every storm. Amen.

Declaration:
I will not be anxious because God is with me. I walk in peace, knowing I am cared for.

Reflection:
Even in moments of overwhelm, God’s presence brings stillness. Take deep breaths and remember you’re not alone.
